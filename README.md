# Camera-Len-Wireless-Follow-Focus-System
***Many documents are not yet complete, the initial version has been released, please waitðŸŒ›***

## Brief Instructions for Use
If you are an enthusiast and only want to make and use it personally, check this document: [Brief instructions for use](https://github.com/ZhongWwwHhh/Camera-Len-Wireless-Follow-Focus-System/blob/main/Documentation/Quickstart.md)

## Developer
This project always welcomes your guidance and help!!!  
This project was designed exclusively for Raspberry Pi Pico.
If you want to use it on other micropython-capable microcontrollers(such as a more powerful Arduino or pyboard), there's another [code explanation](https://github.com/ZhongWwwHhh/Camera-Len-Wireless-Follow-Focus-System/blob/main/Documentation/Codeinterpretation.md) will make this process easier

## Introduction to Project
The project currently implements a rocker potentiometer (the one on an aeromodelling remote control) to remotely and wirelessly control a stepper motor.  
It only requires two Raspberry Pi Pico, a ULN2003 and its driven stepper motor, and a pair of wireless transceiver modules, aiming to achieve the same functional equipment as an expensive commercial wireless follower.  
***In the future, it will gradually increase to be able to control the version of three motors, and add more powerful functions such as A-B point limit, see [Development Log](https://github.com/ZhongWwwHhh/Camera-Len-Wireless-Follow-Focus-System/blob/main/Documentation/Updatelog.md)***  
Receiver and transmitter use the same modular hardware design (PCB), Transmitter-receiver conversion can be achieved by simply brushing different programs  
All software will use micropython for easy modification and application, and all hardware will be designed with Kicad
